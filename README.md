=============

Tailwind CSS Autocomplete plugin for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (v3.2.0).

Note: This plugin only autocompletes based on the default Tailwind CSS class names. It does not extend autocomplete based on your customized `tailwind.config.js`. It is always on for all HTML files.
